# UnitLib

Thanks to Bjarne Stroustrop for his guidance. The idea for this initially came from his Design in C++ course at Columbia University. ([Final project slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tSkXEHGuAYdIVbZiFPN07u9SzXgSZNK1FKTpWuo5bTg/edit?usp=sharing))

## Overview

The overall goal of `UnitLib` is to allow compile-time typed arithmetic with arbitrary dimensional units in arbitrary rectangular shapes and arbitrary integral ratios. This means:

- Any possible units can be defined and used (as opposed to built-in SI units)
- Units can be used in any combination and well-understood (for instance, `Meter * Second == Second * Meter`)
- Units can be organized as vectors and matrices
- Units are well-interoperable with builtin numeric types, which act essentially as unitless scalars. i.e. `float * Meter` should be understandable as `Meter`.
- Arithmetic between units, unitless scalars, Vectors, and Matrices (the four basic types of UnitLib) uses reasonable and expressive syntax that differs little from natural mathematical syntax.
  - In other words we should not have to say `Mult<Vector3<Meter>, Second>`, we should be able to say `Vector3<Meter> * Second` and be well-understood.
- Logical conversion and interpretation of ratios at compile-time.
  - `Meter + Kilometer` should be OK, and `Kilometer / Meter` should be a unitless ratio of 1000.
- As much information as possible (in our case, nearly all information) is preserved through arithmetic. For instance, if we add two units with ratios 1/2 and 1/3, even if they use underlying doubles, instead of computing and coercing into one of the two ratios, we construct a unit with ratio 1/6.
- And, all of this is done at compile time when possible (and again is done so in nearly all cases).

**UnitLib** comprises, essentially, of three types: `Unit`, `Vector`, and `Matrix`, in addition to built-in numeric ("plain") types such as `double`, `float`, and `int`, which are referred to as **plain scalars**.

There is also a special unitless Unit (it uses the `Unit` class but does not represent any dimension), referred to as the `EmptyUnit`.

The design goals and implementation of the four basic types are described below.

## Some Keywords
- **Unit** - referring specifically to any instance of the Unit class
- **EmptyUnit** - referring to the unitless Unit class representing a dimensionless constant
- **plain type** - a non-unit scalar, such as `double`, `int`, etc. However, user-defined types that follow the correct arithmetic properties should also be useable as plain scalars
- **scalar** - any non-vector type (unit or non-unit)
  - **plain scalar** - a non-vector that's a plain type
  - **unit scalar** - a non-vector of type unit
- **GeneralScalar** - a specific `concept` that matches both plain arithmetic types (i.e. `std::is_arithmetic`) and Units

Also, some example types (used for explanation):
```
Meter - SI atomic unit of meter
Kilometer - Meter with ratio 1000

EmptyUnit - empty unit 
Kilo - empty unit with ratio 1000
```

## Overall Structure
In addition to the general goals of units as listed above, we also have the following design pillars:

- Separability of `Unit`, `Vector`, and `Matrix`
- Follow built-in language rules; e.g. `Unit<int...> + Unit<double...>` resolves to `Unit<std::common_type_t<int, double>>`, rather than coercing to one type or the other
- Full interoperability between primary types of scalars, Unit, Vector, and Matrix in "mathematician's expected" ways, using natural syntax
  - e.g. `Mat4 * Vec4 = Vec4`
- Zero overhead in both space and performance relative to primitive types
- Competitive in performance and similar in expressibility to common libraries like [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm)

Since the library is header-only, one important consequence of this, and a key advantage relative to `glm`, is that any of the three components can be used without the others quite easily. One can use the full functionality of `Vector` just by deleting the headers corresponding to `Unit` and `Matrix`. We minimizing coupling wherever possible.

## Units

Fundamentally, units are **a compile-time metadata system** for types.

They have **zero overhead**, **no additional specialization** and **no differentiation between builtin and user-defined types**.

Let's break those down piece by piece:
- **Zero-overhead.** Both for space and for time performance, we should be at par with builtin types like `double`. This can be checked easily with `sizeof(double) == sizeof(Unit<double, ...>)`.
- **No additional specialization.** If it is not necessary for a unit to be able to divide, do not enforce division. Many other unit systems make assumptions about what is possible with a particular type, but this necessarily excludes sets like modular integers over non-prime rings.
- **No differentiation between builtin and user-defined types.** We should not assume that the user will only define `Unit<double>` or `Unit<int>`. They should be able to provide any type they want and the behavior will be identical.

That's why we call it a **a compile-time metadata system**. We should be able to define `Unit<std::string>`, even though it might be logically nonsensical. Users should be allowed to tag ANY type with metadata.


## Plain scalars
- In general, plain scalars and `EmptyUnit` should be one-to-one. That is, in any situation we can use a plain scalar like `float`, we can use `EmptyUnit`, and vice versa.
  - Therefore, `EmptyUnit{1.0} + (double) 1.0` should be well-understood, and `Kilometer / Meter` should be `Kilo`.
  - Basic arithmetic operations `(+=*/)` between units and scalars are all understood
- The only exception is that assignment from plain scalar to EmptyUnit is OK, but assignment from EmptyUnit to plain scalar is not.
  - The reason is that EmptyUnit holds more information than a plain scalar, as it includes a ratio.

## Containers - Vector and Matrix
- Both `Vector` and `Matrix` are implemented as thin containers with zero overhead.
  - Verify: `sizeof(Vector2<double>) == 2 * sizeof(double)`
- Their operations should be unaware of the types they hold, only how they behave. We accomplish this by extensive use of `requires(A a, B b) {a + b;}` and similar constructions.
  - For instance, addition between `Vector2<std::string>` is not well-defined but is for `Vector2<float>`.
- Supports any dimensions of `size_t` (`N` for vectors and `M` x `N` for matrices)
- ...And does so with zero overhead. This is accomplished through compile-time loops using `std::make_integer_sequence`
- Compete with standard libraries such as [glm::vec3](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) in performance and usability
- For `N = 2, 3, 4`, i.e. corresponding to traditional `Vector2/3/4`, and `Mat2/3/4`, prioritize performance, usability, and keeping par with libraries like glm over generality.
  - What this means is, if the `std::make_integer_sequence` is even slightly slower for e.g. size `N=3` (due to indirection or something), it would be better to use `if constexpr(N==3)` and special-case the logic.

One instance of a situation where these principles help to guide our design is in the inclusion of `.x()`, `.y()`, `.z()`, and `.w()` accessors for Vectors. Technically this runs against our usual design philosophy of having the vectors be size-generic as possible. However, because these patterns are common in industry-standard libraries such as `glm`, we consider them important enough to special-case.

Another example of design principles at play: We choose to define the typical `NormSq()` and `Norm()` functions as non-members. The reason is that `Norm()` needs to use square root, and we need to provide a generalized square root that's compatible with units (so that we can support `sqrt(m^1) -> m^1/2`). If `Norm()` was a member of `Vector`, then `Vector` would need to be aware of the details of `Unit`, which goes against our philosophy.

# Design in-depth
Here we dive more specifically into some of our design philosophies, in addition to ones not mentioned above, and how they are implemented

**Follow built-in language patterns**
- Use default constructors instead of zero constructors
- Use decltypes and concepts instead of type coercion/casting
  - But, don't use `std::common_type`, since it only is well-defined for builtin types. Prefer patterns like `decltype(a * b)`

**Plain scalars** - We should avoid defining plain scalars only in terms of built-in C++ types like `double` and `int`. Users should be able to provide their own type wrappers that are compatible witht he unit system. Therefore, using checks like `std::is_arithmetic`, which uses builtin types under the hood, is insufficient.

Instead, we should define our own concepts checking that types have the necessary properties, such as addition and subtraction.

**In general, avoid using standard library type utils** like `common_type` (in addition to `is_arithmetic`, as mentioned). These are often only well-defined for builtin types and a first-class goal of the library is to support user-defined types.

One exception to this is division, because to define it formally we need a notion of multiplicative inverse and identity, and these notions don't really exist in plain C++. We can proxy them somewhat with constructions like `Type{0}` and `Type{1}`, but these can be weird because, for instance, `std::string{0}` -> `"0"`. Because of this, the builtin division is only fully-specified for `std::is_arithmetic` types. It is not difficult for users to add additional overrides for their own types, thanks to the way C++20 concepts work.

**Don't over-specialize.** Don't assume, for instance, that scalars must be addable, dividable, and multipliable in order to be valid units; or don't assume that matrices can only be comprised of types that have a well-defined zero value. Instead, allow for wrappers (`Unit` or `Vector`/`Matrix` containers) to define partial functionality based on what the underlying types support. For instance, `Vector<std::string>::IsZero()` is not well-defined, but `Vector<int>::IsZero()` is.

**When possible, prefer explicit template specialization over concepts when defining functions**

```
// Prefer this syntax
template <typename LHS, typename RHS_Type, UnitIdentifier RHS_UID, IsRatio RHS_Ratio>
inline auto DoThing(const LHS &lhs, const Unit<RHS_Type, RHS_UID, RHS_Ratio> &rhs)
{
    RHS_Type x; // do something with the type
    ...
}

// ...Over this syntax
template <typename LHS, IsUnit RHS>
inline auto DoThing(const LHS &lhs, const RHS &rhs)
{
    typename RHS::type x; // do something with the type
    ...
}
```

Although the latter is debatably more readable, the issue is that concepts have to be valid for any type and cannot have partial constraints, and therefore cannot be defined inside of function or class scopes. This also means that the `IsUnit` concept cannot possibly be available within the `Unit` class itself, making the former syntax a necessity. 

It is technically possible to use the former syntax for `Unit` member functions and then use the latter syntax for nonmember functions, but this divergence in syntax is not preferred. Consistency is better.

There are some cases where it's unavoidable or whereusing it would make the code severely more readable. In those cases it's fine, but in general we should prefer to be explicit. One example is here:
```
template <IsUnit U, IsRatio Ratio>
using UnitMultRatio = Unit<
    typename U::type,
    typename U::uid,
    std::ratio_multiply<Ratio, typename U::ratio>>;
```

The reason is that this helper is used to define things like `Kilometer` from `Meter` and is used like this:
```
using Kilometer = UnitMultRatio<Meter, std::ratio<1000>>;
```
In this case, this is preferred over having users of the library type `UnitMultRatio<double, "meter", std::ratio<1>, std::ratio<1000>>`.

Similar things apply for the `IsVector` and `IsMatrix` concepts.

**Prefer parameter packs to `std::initializer_list` when possible**
- Why? Because one of our primary aims is to have total equivalency between Empty Units and floats. With `initializer_list`, we can't do this (since it enforces homogeneous typing):
```
Matrix2<Meter> m2 = {{1, 2}, {(double)3, EmptyUnit{4}}};
```

This can actually be quite annoying in some cases. For instance:
```
assert(( Inv(Matrix<3, 3, double>{{4, 7, 2}, {3, 6, 1}, {2, 5, 1}}) ==  Matrix<3, 3, double>{{1.0/3.0, 1, -5.0/3.0}, {-1.0/3.0, 0, 2.0/3.0}, {1.0, -2.0, 1}} ));
```

This won't compile since `1.0/3.0` is type double and `1` is type integer.

**Prefer to explicitly specify commutative operations**.

This is tempting:
```
template <typename LHS, typename RHS_Type, UnitIdentifier RHS_UID, IsRatio RHS_Ratio>
    requires CanOpAdd<Unit<RHS_Type, RHS_UID, RHS_Ratio>, LHS>
inline OpAddType<Unit<RHS_Type, RHS_UID, RHS_Ratio>, LHS> operator+(const LHS &lhs, const Unit<RHS_Type, RHS_UID, RHS_Ratio> &rhs)
{
    return rhs.operator+(lhs);
}
```

However, it often leads to recursion errors, since the right-side operation checks for the left-side operation, and so on.

This is better:
```
/** @brief Right-multiply by scalar */
template <typename LHS_VecType, size_t N, typename RHS_Type>
    requires(!IsVector<RHS_Type>) && CanMultiply<LHS_VecType, RHS_Type>
inline Vector<N, MultiplyType<LHS_VecType, RHS_Type>> operator*(const Vector<N, LHS_VecType> &lhs_v, const RHS_Type &rhs)
{
    return ([&]<size_t... Is>(std::index_sequence<Is...>) constexpr
            {
                return Vector<N, MultiplyType<LHS_VecType, RHS_Type>>{(lhs_v[Is] * rhs)...}; // Expands the expression for each index
            })(std::make_index_sequence<N>{});
}

/** @brief Left-multiply by scalar */
template <typename RHS_VecType, size_t N, typename LHS_Type>
    requires(!IsVector<LHS_Type>) && CanMultiply<RHS_VecType, LHS_Type>
inline Vector<N, MultiplyType<LHS_Type, RHS_VecType>> operator*(const LHS_Type &lhs, const Vector<N, RHS_VecType> &rhs_v)
{
    return ([&]<size_t... Is>(std::index_sequence<Is...>) constexpr
            {
                return Vector<N, MultiplyType<LHS_Type, RHS_VecType>>{(lhs * rhs_v[Is])...}; // Expands the expression for each index
            })(std::make_index_sequence<N>{});
}
```
